## Guiding Principles

### Minimal Dependencies
Every dependency you add is a liability that you need to work around. We believe in owning your code base and not depending on external libraries (as much as it makes sense). We only use the essential packages maintained by the Flutter or Dart team; the rest is native Flutter code.

### MVVM Architecture
There are many architectures and state management approaches. They can all work, but the more time you spend choosing and deliberating, the less time you spend building products. We use the MVVM Architecture, which has been battle-tested by us and recommended by the Flutter team.

### Own Your Code
This could have been a package, but we believe in owning your code. All these features are code that you can use, explore, and update for your use cases. (Let us know about your updates so we can potentially improve the boilerplate.)

### Align with the Flutter Team
Our goal is to align closely with the Flutter team's recommendations and best practices. When something is missing, we use our expertise to fill the gaps.
